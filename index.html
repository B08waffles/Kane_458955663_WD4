                        <p>Linux (LEEN-uuks or /ˈlɪnʊks/ LIN-uuks[9]) is a family of open-source Unix-like operating
                            systems
                            based on the Linux kernel,[10] an operating system kernel first released on September 17,
                            1991,
                            by Linus Torvalds.[11][12][13] Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution.

                            Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of
                            which are provided by the GNU Project. Many Linux distributions use the word "Linux" in
                            their
                            name, but the Free Software Foundation uses the name "GNU/Linux" to emphasize the importance
                            of
                            GNU software, causing some controversy.[14][15]

                            Popular Linux distributions[16][17][18] include Debian, Fedora, and Ubuntu. Commercial
                            distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. Desktop
                            Linux
                            distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland, and a desktop environment
                            such
                            as GNOME or KDE Plasma. Distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether, or
                            include a solution stack such as LAMP. Because Linux is freely redistributable, anyone may
                            create a distribution for any purpose.[19]

                        <p>Debian (/ˈdɛbiən/),[5][6] also known as Debian GNU/Linux, is a GNU/Linux distribution
                            composed of
                            free and open-source software, developed by the community-supported Debian Project, which
                            was
                            established by Ian Murdock on August 16, 1993. The first version of Debian (0.01) was
                            released
                            on September 15, 1993,[7] and its first stable version (1.1) was released on June 17,
                            1996.[8]
                            The Debian Stable branch is the most popular edition for personal computers and servers.
                            Debian
                            is also the basis for many other distributions, most notably Ubuntu.

                            Debian is one of the oldest operating systems based on the Linux kernel. The project is
                            coordinated over the Internet by a team of volunteers guided by the Debian Project Leader
                            and
                            three foundational documents: the Debian Social Contract, the Debian Constitution, and the
                            Debian Free Software Guidelines. New distributions are updated continually, and the next
                            candidate is released after a time-based freeze.

                            Since its founding, Debian has been developed openly and distributed freely according to the
                            principles of the GNU Project.</p>

                        <p>Fedora Linux[7] is a Linux distribution developed by the community-supported Fedora Project
                            which
                            is sponsored primarily by Red Hat, a subsidiary of IBM, with additional support from other
                            companies.[8] Fedora contains software distributed under various free and open-source
                            licenses
                            and aims to be on the leading edge of free technologies.[9][10][11] Fedora is the upstream
                            source of the commercial Red Hat Enterprise Linux distribution and for CentOS.[12] Fedora is
                            a
                            fork of Red Hat Linux since RHL was discontinued in 2003.

                            Since the release of Fedora 30, five different editions are currently available:
                            Workstation,
                            focused on the personal computer, Server for servers, CoreOS, focused on cloud computing,
                            Silverblue, focused on an immutable desktop specialized to container-based workflows and
                            IoT,
                            focused on IoT devices.[13]

                            As of February 2016, Fedora has an estimated 1.2 million users,[14] including Linus Torvalds
                            (as
                            of May 2020), creator of the Linux kernel.[15][16][17]</p>

                        <p>Ubuntu (/ʊˈbʊntuː/ uu-BUUN-too)[6] (Stylized as ubuntu) is a Linux
                            distribution based on Debian and composed mostly of free and open-source software.[7][8][9]
                            Ubuntu is officially released in three editions: Desktop,[10] Server,[11] and Core[12] for
                            Internet of things devices[13] and robots.[14][15] All the editions can run on the computer
                            alone, or in a virtual machine.[16] Ubuntu is a popular operating system for cloud
                            computing,
                            with support for OpenStack.[17] Ubuntu's default desktop has been GNOME, since version
                            17.10.[18]

                            Ubuntu is released every six months, with long-term support (LTS) releases every two
                            years.[6][19][20] As of 22 April 2021, the most recent long-term support release is 20.04
                            ("Focal Fossa"), which is supported until 2025 under public support and until 2030 as a paid
                            option for companies and free for individuals who register.[21] The latest standard release
                            is
                            21.10 ("Impish Indri"), which is supported for nine months.

                            Ubuntu is developed by Canonical,[22] and a community of other developers, under a
                            meritocratic
                            governance model.
